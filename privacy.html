    <h1>ClawPhone Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 5, 2026</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>ClawPhone ("we", "our", or "the app") is a voice chat interface that connects to your personal AI assistant. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>
    
    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Voice Data:</strong> Voice recordings are processed in real-time for speech-to-text conversion and are not stored permanently on our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Messages:</strong> Text messages sent through the app are transmitted to your connected AI assistant. Message history may be stored locally on your device.</p>
    <p><strong>Device Identifier:</strong> A random device identifier is used to maintain your connection to your AI assistant. This is not linked to your personal identity.</p>
    
    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect your name, email, or contact information</li>
        <li>We do not track your location</li>
        <li>We do not sell any data to third parties</li>
        <li>We do not use your data for advertising</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p><strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> We use Fish Audio for voice synthesis. Voice output is generated based on your AI's responses. No personal data is shared with this service.</p>
    <p><strong>Your AI Assistant:</strong> Messages are sent to your personally configured AI assistant (Clawbot). The data handling for your AI is governed by your own configuration.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All communications between the app and our servers use HTTPS encryption. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>ClawPhone is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can disconnect your AI assistant at any time from the app settings. Local message history can be cleared by reinstalling the app.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page.</p>
